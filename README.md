### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

### Algorithm:  1. Direct Instruction Prompts
To build a virtual AI assistant that helps customers resolve product issues, track their orders, and answer general queries. This task involves applying multiple prompting frameworks—from straightforward instructions to context-aware and persona-based prompts—to fine-tune the chatbot's responses and behavior.

1.Start the experiment and define the chatbot’s objective.
2.Identify and select various prompting techniques to be used.
3.Design appropriate prompts for each selected technique.
4.Input the prompts into the AI model and execute them.
5.Observe and analyze the chatbot’s responses for accuracy and tone.
6.Record the results and conclude the experiment.

###  Prompting Techniques :

1. Direct Command Prompts
Purpose: Instruct the chatbot to respond briefly and directly to user requests.
Example Prompt:
“When a customer asks about their order status, respond with: ‘Your order is being processed and should arrive by [date].’”

2. Context-Based Prompting
Purpose: Make responses more personalized by referencing earlier parts of the conversation.
Example Prompt:
“If the customer previously said they haven’t received their order, respond: ‘You mentioned your order hasn’t arrived. Let me check on that and get back to you.’”

3. Persona-Driven Prompting
Purpose: Humanize the chatbot by giving it a friendly and relatable personality.
Example Prompt:
“Act as a warm, approachable support representative. Start with: ‘Hi there! I'm here to help. Let’s sort this out together!’”

4. Few-Shot Learning Prompts
Purpose: Show the chatbot how to answer by giving a few sample Q&A pairs.
Example Prompt:
Examples:

‘My phone won’t charge.’ → ‘Try another charger. If the issue remains, it might be the port.’
‘My screen flickers.’ → ‘Try restarting it. It could be a display issue.’
Now respond to: ‘My app keeps crashing.’

5. Step-by-Step (Chain-of-Thought) Prompting
Purpose: Encourage the chatbot to follow logical steps for complex problems.
Example Prompt:
“When a user complains about laptop overheating, proceed with:
Ask about the surface it’s placed on.
Suggest moving to a hard surface.
Ask if vents were cleaned.
Recommend a restart.
Now handle: ‘My laptop fan is loud.’”

6. Constraint-Based Prompting
Purpose: Limit response length or complexity to keep it user-friendly.
Example Prompt:
“Keep order updates under 50 words and use plain English. For instance: ‘Your package is on the way and should reach you by [date]. Reach out if needed.’”

7. Reflective Questioning
Purpose: Repeat the user’s question before replying to ensure clarity.
Example Prompt:
If the user says, ‘How do I change my password?’ reply with: ‘You're asking how to change your password, right? Let me guide you through the steps.’”
