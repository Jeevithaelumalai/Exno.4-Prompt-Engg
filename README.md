### REGISTER NUMBER : 212223220067
### Aim: To design an AI-powered chatbot that assists customers in resolving issues related to product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The chatbot should handle various customer queries efficiently while maintaining a conversational and user-friendly tone. In this experiment, we will employ different prompt patterns to guide the development process of the chatbot, ranging from basic task-oriented prompts to more complex, persona-driven prompts.

### Algorithm: 
Step 1: Define Chatbot Objective
1.Set the goal: Assist customers with product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries.
2,Ensure the chatbot remains user-friendly, conversational, and efficient.
Step 2: Select Prompting Techniques
1.Identify different prompting strategies to guide the chatbot behavior:
2.Direct Instruction
3.Contextual Prompting
4.Persona-Based Prompting
5.Few-Shot Prompting
6.Chain of Thought Prompting
7.Instruction with Constraints
8.Reflective Prompting
Step 3: Design Prompt Patterns
1.For each prompting technique, design a specific prompt pattern:
2.Provide an example prompt.
3.Mention the chatbot’s expected behavior.
Step 4: Implement Prompting Techniques
1.Configure the chatbot's response generation system:
2.Direct Instruction: Use static, task-focused replies.
3.Contextual Prompting: Integrate memory of previous user interactions.
4.Persona-Based Prompting: Build a tone/persona (friendly, helpful).
5.Few-Shot Prompting: Train the system with examples for various situations.
6.Chain of Thought Prompting: Implement logical, step-by-step reasoning.
7.Instruction with Constraints: Control word limit and complexity.
8.Reflective Prompting: Reconfirm user's request before answering.
Step 5: Train and Fine-Tune the Chatbot
1.Input the prompts into the chatbot engine.
2.Test with simulated user queries covering troubleshooting, tracking, and inquiries.
Step 6: Evaluate Chatbot Behavior
Check for:
1.Accuracy of responses
2.Tone friendliness
3.Ability to handle multi-turn conversations
4.Clarity and efficiency
Step 7: Record Results
Verify if all prompt patterns work as intended.

## Prompt Techniques:
### 1. Direct Instruction Prompting
Objective:
Provide straightforward, concise responses to customer inquiries.
Example Prompt:
"When a customer asks about their order status, reply: 'Your order is currently being processed and will be delivered by [date].'"

#### 2. Contextual Prompting
Objective:
Incorporate previous user interactions to offer more personalized and detailed responses.
Example Prompt:
"If a customer mentions a missing order earlier, respond: 'I see that you mentioned your order hasn't arrived yet. Let me check the details for you.'"

### 3. Persona-Based Prompting
Objective:
Humanize the chatbot by assigning it a friendly, helpful persona.
Example Prompt:
"Act as a warm customer service agent: 'Hey there! I’m here to help with any questions. Let’s get your issue sorted!'"

### 4. Few-Shot Prompting
Objective:
Train the chatbot with a few example interactions to help it generalize solutions to similar queries.
Example Prompt:
Handling technical problems:

'My phone isn't charging.' → 'Have you tried using a different cable?'

'The screen is flickering.' → 'It might be a display issue. Try restarting the device.'

Now for:

'My app keeps crashing.' → Expected similar step-by-step suggestion.

### 5. Chain of Thought Prompting
Objective:
Encourage step-by-step troubleshooting for complex technical problems.
Example Prompt:
For overheating laptops:

Check surface type.

Recommend better airflow.

Suggest cleaning vents.

Restart the device.

Applied to:

'My laptop fan is making a loud noise.'

### 6. Instruction with Constraints
Objective:
Ensure responses stay brief and non-technical.
Example Prompt:
"Reply in fewer than 50 words, no technical jargon: 'Your order is on the way and should arrive by [date].'"

### 7. Reflective Prompting
Objective:
Reflect the customer’s query back to them before responding, ensuring clarity.
Example Prompt:
Customer: 'How can I reset my password?'
Chatbot: 'You're asking how to reset your password, correct? Here's how you can do it...'
